-   The classic [JHipster Sample App](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-sample-app-helidon)

# Prerequisites

```

To update this blueprint:

```

# Usage

## Running local Blueprint version for development

During development of blueprint, please note the below steps. They are very important.

1. Link your blueprint globally

Note: If you do not want to link the blueprint(step 3) to each project being created, use NPM instead of Yarn as yeoman doesn't seem to fetch globally linked Yarn modules. On the other hand, this means you have to use NPM in all the below steps as well.

```bash

cd jhipster-helidon

npm link

```

2. Link the development version of JHipster to your blueprint (optional: required only if you want to use a non-released JHipster version, like the master branch or your own custom fork)

```bash

cd generator-jhipster

npm link



cd helidon

npm link generator-jhipster

```

1. Create a new folder for the app to be generated and link JHipster and your blueprint there

```bash

mkdir my-app && cd my-app



npm link generator-jhipster-helidon

npm link generator-jhipster (Optional: Needed only if you are using a non-released JHipster version)



jhipster -d --blueprint helidon

```

ðŸš¦ What we have now

âœ… Generate App generation - `jhipster --blueprints helidon`

âœ… Entity generation - `jhipster --blueprints helidon entity <entity-name>`
